TODO:
  get favicon
  play different modes
  joining modes gives increase score
  can upgrade different modes
  upgrades below main screen
  need controls that work with mobile
  start with intro screen implying there is more than initial level (maybe something like ms pac man cut scene)
  get game centered in canvas
  why can't we loop around if we are all the way to the left, going up, and press the 'a' key?

  pacman, snake, space invaders 
  start as pacman going to work
  get captured by invader
  play space invaders
  just about to win, ok, then try this
  sends you into snake game. invaders are still around
  just as you're about to win, ok, then try this
  sends you into pacman game. with snake and invaders
  when you win, you wake up. it was all a dream.
  you head to work and it starts all over again

  along the way, if you die, it's game over
  you need to use points and prestige points to power up pacman to
    prevent death and improve chances of life
